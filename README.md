ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Yanko!
ðŸš€ Aspiring Backend Developer | Passionate about APIs, Real-Time Systems & DevOps
ðŸ‘€ Interests: Backend development for APIs & real-time systems, cloud technologies, and automation.
ðŸ›  Tech Stack: Node.js, Express.js, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS (Learning), Python, Ruby (Planned)
ðŸŒ± Currently Learning: API development, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, and mastering Express.js before diving into TypeScript, NestJS, Koa, and Hono. Python and Ruby backend technologies are also on the roadmap.
ðŸŽ¯ Goal: To build scalable and efficient backend systems and become the ultimate backend web developer.
âš¡ Fun Fact: When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m deep into motorsports, NFL, and esports. I closely follow the Kansas City Chiefs, Porsche factory & customer teams (WEC, IMSA, GTWC, IGTC), and McLaren & Williams in F1. Someday, Iâ€™d love to get my hands on a proper sim racing setup!
ðŸ’¡ Always eager to learn, build, and push boundaries in backend development.
